# Example configuration for migrating from Cassandra:
  source:
    type: cassandra
    host: <SOURCE_IP_ADDRESS>
    port: 9042
    credentials:
      username: migrator
      password: <PASSWORD>
    keyspace: <SOURCE_KEYSPACE>
    table: <TABLE>
    # Preserve TTLs and WRITETIMEs of cells in the source database. Note that this
    # option is *incompatible* when copying tables with collections (lists, maps, sets).
    preserveTimestamps: true
    # Number of splits to use - this should be at minimum the amount of cores
    # available in the Spark cluster, and optimally more; higher splits will lead
    # to more fine-grained resumes. Aim for 8 * (Spark cores).
    splitCount: 256
    # Number of connections to use to Cassandra when copying
    connections: 8
    # Number of rows to fetch in each read
    fetchSize: 1000

  # Configuration for the database you're copying into
  target:
    type: scylla
    host: <DESTINATION_IP_ADDRESS>
    port: 9042
    credentials:
      username: <USERNAME>
      password: <PASSWORD>
    # NOTE: The destination table must have the same schema as the source table.
    # If you'd like to rename columns, that's ok - see the renames parameter below.
    keyspace: <DESTINATION_KEYSPACE>
    table: <TABLE>
    # Number of connections to use to Scylla when copying
    connections: 16

  # Savepoints are configuration files (like this one), saved by the migrator as it
  # runs. Their purpose is to skip token ranges that have already been copied. This
  # configuration only applies when copying from Cassandra/Scylla.
  savepoints:
    # Where should savepoint configurations be stored? This is a path on the host running
    # the Spark driver - usually the Spark master.
    path: /app/savepoints
    # Interval in which savepoints will be created
    intervalSeconds: 300

  # Column renaming configuration. If you'd like to rename any columns, specify them like so:
  # - from: source_column_name
  #   to: dest_column_name
  renames: []
  # Which token ranges to skip. You shouldn't need to fill this in normally; the migrator will
  # create a savepoint file with this filled.
  skipTokenRanges: []

  # Configuration section for running the validator. The validator is run manually (see README)
  # and currently only supports comparing a Cassandra source to a Scylla target.
  validation:
    # Should WRITETIMEs and TTLs be compared?
    compareTimestamps: true
    # What difference should we allow between TTLs?
    ttlToleranceMillis: 60000
    # What difference should we allow between WRITETIMEs?
    writetimeToleranceMillis: 1000
    # How many differences to fetch and print
    failuresToFetch: 100
    # What difference should we allow between floating point numbers?
    floatingPointTolerance: 0.001
