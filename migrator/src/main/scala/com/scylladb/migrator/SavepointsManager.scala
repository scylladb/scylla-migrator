/**
  * A component that manages savepoints. Savepoints provide a way to resume an interrupted migration.
  *
  * This component periodically stores savepoints according to the schedule defined in the configuration.
  * It also automatically stores a savepoint in case of early termination (e.g. due to a SIGTERM signal).
  *
  * Internally, it works by writing modified copies of the original migration configuration. These copies
  * specify which parts of the source dataset have already been migrated and can safely be skipped when
  * restarting the migration.
  *
  * Make sure to call the method `close` when you donâ€™t need the savepoints manager anymore so that it
  * releases the resources it was using.
  *
  * This class is abstract. Subclasses are responsible for implementing how to track the migration progress,
  * and for communicating the updated state of the migration via the method `updateConfigWithMigrationState`.
